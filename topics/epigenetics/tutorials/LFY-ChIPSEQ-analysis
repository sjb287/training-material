# QC Analysis
Several aspects can go wrong in a ChIP-SEQ experiment, problems can arise from using poor quality or unspecific antibodies, sometimes there is little enrichment during immunoprecipitation, or amplification and fragmentation biases can occur during library preparation. It is therefore necessary to run QC checks on data to determine if an experiment has been successful.

There are several common measures to determine the quality of a ChIP-SEQ experiment including sample similarity, strength of enrichment, numbers of reads in peaks, sample depth, low enrichment in control and GC bias. In this tutorial we will focus on two QC checks, using programs from the “deepTools” package to perform the analysis (more information on deepTools can be found here). But it is advised to read the ENCODE guidelines for a deeper understanding of the quality control measures.
First we will look at sample similarity, in this approach we compare read counts at each genomic location between samples, as we expect that replicate samples should be more similar to each other than others. 

## Assessing the correlation between samples

First we will use **multiBamSummary** to split the reference genome into bins of equal size and counts the number of reads in each bin from each sample, then **plotCorrelation** will be used to visualize the results.

Next we will look at whether we see a peak of LFY binding upstream of TSSs as might be expected for a transcription factor.

## Assessing IP quality

Next we will assess the quality of the immunopreciptation step in the protocol using **plotFingerprint**. This tool determines how well the ChIP signal can be detected compared to background distribution of reads in a sample. More information about how the procedure is performed can be found here

# Peak calling

Now that we are confident that the ChIP protocol was successful we will proceed to identify enriched regions known as "peaks" which represent the genomic sites where LFY binds. To do this, we will use the program **MACS2** which calculates a p-value for each peak using a Poisson distribution to capture local biases in read background levels. Analysis will be performed separately on each input sample then the irreproducible discovery rate (IDR) calculated to determine peaks which were reproducible between replicates.

# Motif prediction

Finally we will aim to predict the binding sequence of LFY using the tool **MEME-ChIP** which  discovers sequence motifs characteristic of a TF given a set of input sequences. We will therefore use **bedtools** to extract the DNA sequences of the IDR ChIP peaks and use this as an input for motif discovery.
